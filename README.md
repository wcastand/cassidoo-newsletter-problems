## Problems

## Lonely number

Given three numbers, return their product. But, if one of the numbers is the same as another, it does not count: If two numbers are similar, return the lonely number. If all numbers are same, return 1.

```
$ lonelyNumber(1,2,3)
$ 6

$ lonelyNumber(6,6,4)
$ 4

$ lonelyNumber(7,7,7)
$ 1
```

## Print Arrow

Given a direction and a number of columns, write a function that outputs an arrow of asterisks (see the pattern in the examples below)!

`arrow('right', 3)`

```
*
 *
  *
 *
*
```

`arrow('left', 5)`

```
    *
   *
  *
 *
*
 *
  *
   *
    *
```
